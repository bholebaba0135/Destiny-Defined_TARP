# Destiny-Defined_TARP

### Project Title 

Mutli Destination Most Optimal Route Planner

### Objective
We wish to build a web app that would enable tourists who may wish to travel to multiple destinations in a new city to navigate the shortest route without passing the same street twice. This would prove to be really useful in travel planning. 

### Development Model

Iterative Waterfall<br>
<br>
In this process model, the development process is divided into several phases such as requirement gathering, design, coding, testing and deployment.
Each phase is executed only when the previous phase is completed, so it is a step by step process without parallelism.
It is suitable for small scale projects with low risks, when quality is preferred over cost and requirements are well-known upfront.
The iterative nature provides for error correction at the end of each phase leading to less errors in the final testing phase.

### Literature Survey
|  Title  |  Author  |  Algorithm and dataset  |  Important Findings  |  Limitations  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|Route recommendation system to support multiple destinations and multiple routes to minimise road congestion |Chayanon Sub-r-pa, Goutam Chakraborty, Bhabani P. Sinha|The algorithm selects n-best routes and assigns a car to one of them based on calculated probabilities. It calculates trial routes using Yen's algorithm and distributes cars based on probability values. Finally, it generates a random number to choose a route. For the road network, a part of the map affected by tsunami after the great Earthquake in North Japan on 11 March 2011 is used. |The proposed MDMR road navigation algorithm can find multiple near-optimal routes to target destinations, eliminate routes with multiple destination points, and distribute vehicles to prevent traffic congestion. The simulations results using real map data from Miyako, Japan, confirm that distributing traffic along multiple routes can significantly increase the number of vehicles arrived at safe destinations and reduce evacuation time.|The assumption of fixed update intervals and virtual link cost as zero are limitations, and the future work will incorporate dynamic route update intervals and modifications to accommodate traffic flowing into destinations.|
|Xhare-a-Ride: A Search Optimized Dynamic Ride Sharing System with Approximation Guarantee |Raja Subramaniam Thangaraj, Koyel Mukherjee, Gurulingesh Raravi, Asmita Metrewar, Narendra Annamaneni and Koushik Chattopadhyay |This research extracted 350,000 taxi journeys from publicly available New York City taxi travel data on a random day. They explain how they created ride sharing data from the dataset's taxi travels. All NY taxi journeys are simulated as ride requests for XAR evaluation. If numerous rides match a request, the algorithm chooses the one with the shortest walking distance. If no matching rides are located, a 4-person taxi is constructed.|Experimental evaluations show that XAR outperforms the state-of-the-art system T-Share in the ride search operation, making it a highly scalable and search-optimized system. This is crucial for integrating with MMTP, which has a high look-to-book ratio. XAR also provides an environment-friendly transport option when combined with public transport, resulting in fewer vehicles on the road.|Taxi is fastest, however it is not eco-friendly and worsens traffic. Public transportation emits less but performs poorly. Ride sharing reduces car use by 64% with only a 30% increase in journey time, balancing quality and eco-friendliness. Ride sharing reduces walking time by 56%, travel time by 30%, and cars needed by approximately 50%.|
|Parallel Hyper-Heuristic Algorithm for Multi-Objective Route Planning in a Smart City |Yuan Yao, Zhe Peng, Bin Xiao|The research provides a multi-objective hyper-heuristic (MOHH) framework for smart city walking route planning. The system comprises low-level heuristics for route generation and a reinforcement learning mechanism for picking excellent heuristics to speed up search. In a general-purpose graphics processing unit, RL-MOHH and RL-PMOHH are implemented. This study collected a lot of New York City cross-domain urban data. Urban map, housing rent and density, population, police stations, POIs, crime records, and taxi trajectories were added.|The application offers three route options to the user: the shortest route, the safest route, and a trade-off route based on the user's preference. By default, the trade-off route is determined by a weight vector of 0.4 for distance and 0.6 for safety, but the user can adjust the vector before planning. As the risk of crime increases later in the day, the application can update the safety index of the map and help users avoid high-risk roads by suggesting alternate routes.|The paper notes that the MOHH/PMOHH frameworks still require a significant amount of time to train the utilities of the low-level heuristics. They plan to implement a more efficient online learning algorithm in future work to improve the continuous learning ability of MOHH/PMOHH.|
