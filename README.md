# Destiny-Defined_TARP

### Project Title 

Mutli Destination Most Optimal Route Planner

### Objective
We wish to build a web app that would enable tourists who may wish to travel to multiple destinations in a new city to navigate the shortest route without passing the same street twice. This would prove to be really useful in travel planning. 

### Development Model

Iterative Waterfall<br>
<br>
In this process model, the development process is divided into several phases such as requirement gathering, design, coding, testing and deployment.
Each phase is executed only when the previous phase is completed, so it is a step by step process without parallelism.
It is suitable for small scale projects with low risks, when quality is preferred over cost and requirements are well-known upfront.
The iterative nature provides for error correction at the end of each phase leading to less errors in the final testing phase.

| Expert Systems with Applications | Pieter Vansteenwegen (2011) | The proposed solution approach in this paper is based on a Greedy Randomised Adaptive Search Procedure (GRASP). This metaheuristic was first introduced by Feo and Resende (1989); it was successfully applied to the Team OP, without time windows, by Souffriau, Vansteenwegen, Vanden Berghe, and Van Oudheusden (2010). | The TOP/TW is a difficult combinatorial optimisation problem. A good suboptimal solution will suffice. Indeed, a small loss in solution quality is insignificant for the application, considering the inherent shortcomings of quantifying a touristâ€™s personal interest in a location. For these reasons, the authors propose a metaheuristic as a solution method. | The limitations are Fixed Traffic Condition, Computational Complexity and Incomplete Data | Baeza-Yates, R., & Ribeiro-Neto, R.

| A Development of Travel Itinerary Planning Application using Traveling Salesman Problem and K-Means Clustering Approach |  Septia Rani, Kartika Nur Kholidah, Sheila Nurul Huda | The development of a travel itinerary planning application using the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) and K-Means Clustering approach involves the use of algorithms to generate the most efficient travel route for a given set of destinations. The dataset used in this application would consist of a list of destinations, their respective locations (latitude and longitude), and other relevant information such as opening hours, admission fees, and ratings. | The application allows users to create personalized travel plans based on their preferences and interests. This helps in creating a unique travel experience for each user, and also provides real-time updates on travel routes and destination recommendations based on user feedback. This helps in creating a flexible travel plan that can be adjusted based on user preferences. | The limitations are Computational Complexity, Lack of Flexibility and Inaccurate Recommendations. | Hsu, F.

| An efficient multi-destinations trip planning protocol for intelligent transport system | Hisham Siam and Maram Bani Younes | The technology of Intelligent Transport System (ITS) helped them to introduce protocols that serve drivers during their trips in a real-time fashion. A global optimal path-planning algorithm that uses real-time traffic information. This algorithm uses a hybrid technology of vehicular network and enhanced ITS to analyze the traffic and recommend the best path for drivers. | The metrics depend on the time each vehicle spends driving on the streets. Because of this, they have assumed that drivers do not spend anytime at any destination, then we have also assumed the entire trip starts and ends during the same period of time. | The limitations are insufficient data, computational complexity and traffic conditions. | Collins K, Muntean G-M.

| Multi-Destination Vehicular Route Planning with Parking and Traffic Constraints | Abeer et al. (2019) | The algorithm uses a clustering phase and a graph search phase. In the clustering phase, the algorithm groups destinations that are close to each other to reduce the search space. In the graph search phase, the algorithm uses a modified version of the A* algorithm to find the optimal path between the clusters while taking into account parking and traffic constraints . The article uses real world traffic data and synthetic parking data | The proposed algorithm was evaluated and compared with Nearest Neighbour algorithm and the Traveling Salesman Problem algorithm. The simulations show that the proposed algorithm outperforms the other algorithms in terms of both route quality and computation time. | The limitations are Limited Parking Availability , Fixed Traffic Conditions , Incomplete Data , Computational Complexity | Hakeem, A., Gehani, N., Ding, X., Curtmola, R., & Borcea, C.

| Multi-Destinations Round Trip Planner Protocol | Hisham Siam , Maram Bani Younes | This paper presents a real- time multi-destinations round trip planner protocol. The proposed protocol considers the relative locations of the targeted destinations and the traffic characteristics over the road network. Â This protocol uses the location of each destination on the downtown area and the predicted and real-time traffic characteristics there. The traffic characteristics of each road segment are provided to our protocol using the GPS satellites. | All of the previous research studies have recommended Â the path towards a certain destination. None of them have presented a full path towards multiple destinations. In this a path planning protocol that intends to find the best sequence of visiting set of destinations and recommends the best path between each two successive ones. All candidate paths (sequences) of visiting these destinations are explored. After that, the shortest road distance and the shortest estimated traveling time are computed between each two targeted destinations in that trip. | The limitations are computational complexity, incomplete data of traffic characteristics of road segment and delay in real time traffic distribution data. | Siam, H., & Younes, M.

It uses real-time transit data to provide optimal routes for users. | The proposed system was effective in providing optimal multimodal transit routes to users, taking into account real-time transit data and user preferences and constraints. The system was able to generate routes that were both efficient and convenient, taking into account factors such as travel time, cost, and transfer times. The use of real-time transit data was crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the system's recommendations, as it allowed the system to account for unexpected events such as delays or cancellations. | The limitations include limited coverage of real-time transit data, Â limited consideration of user preferences and constraints , Â Difficulty in accounting for user behaviourÂ  and complexity of the system.  | Borole, N., Rout, D., Goel, N., Vedagiri, P., & Mathew, T.

3. Paper title : Designing a route planner to facilitate and promote cycling in Metro Vancouver,Canada
    
     The methodology of the paper "Designing a route planner to facilitate and promote cycling in Metro Vancouver, Canada" involves the development of a cycling route planner that incorporates various factors that influence the choice of cycling as a mode of transport. The planner is designed using a geographical information system-based approach and includes variables such as distance, elevation gain, safety, route features, air pollution, and links to transit. The planner also allows for the incorporation of multiple user preferences in route selection, uses topology to minimize data storage redundancy, and relies on node/vertex index tables to increase the efficiency of the route selection process. Overall, the methodology involves the integration of various technological and user-centered approaches to develop a cycling route planner that is effective and user-friendly.
